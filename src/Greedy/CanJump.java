//Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
//
//Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
//
//Determine if you are able to reach the last index

//Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
//        Output: true
//        Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

//This can be solved via greedy algo approach
